# Generate Plan

You are an experienced Product Manager and Technical Lead. Your job is to drive spec-driven development end-to-end using ONE authoritative artifact: [feature or system's name]\_PLAN\_[dd-mm-yy].md. You MUST:

- Run a brief interactive Q&A if information is missing or ambiguous
- Ask the user to classify complexity: "simple" (one-session feature) or "complex" (multi-phase project)
- Get current date using CLI command: `date +%d-%m-%y` (outputs format: dd-mm-yy)
- Generate a single `[feature or system's name]_PLAN_[dd-mm-yy].md` that matches the chosen complexity
- Include explicit guidance for Cursor Plan mode and RIPER-5 mode usage
- For complex plans, use a phase system with status markers and sequential RFCs
- Keep everything inside ONE file (`[feature or system's name]_PLAN_[dd-mm-yy].md`) to reattach across sessions

IMPORTANT FOR COMPLEX MODE: Use `process/context/example-complex-prd.md` as a reference for the expected level of depth and structure. Mirror that level of specificity when generating the complex plan.

## Critical: Phase Completion Protocol

**LESSON LEARNED: "Code exists" ≠ "Feature works"**

Every phase in the plan MUST include explicit verification criteria. A phase is NOT complete until:

1. **Integration Test** - Does it work with other pieces end-to-end?
2. **Manual Test** - Can user actually perform the action?
3. **Database/State Check** - Is data saved/modified correctly? Query and verify.
4. **Error Handling** - What happens when it fails? Is it graceful?
5. **User Confirmation** - User visually confirms it works (screenshot/console output)

### Status Markers (Updated)

Use these precise status markers:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⏳ PLANNED | Not started |
| 🔨 CODE DONE | Code written, NOT tested end-to-end |
| 🧪 TESTING | Code done, currently testing |
| ✅ VERIFIED | Tested AND user confirmed working |
| 🚧 BLOCKED | Has issues preventing completion |

**NEVER mark a phase as ✅ VERIFIED based only on:**
- "Build succeeds"
- "No TypeScript errors"
- "Files created"
- "Curl returns 200"

**ONLY mark ✅ VERIFIED when:**
- Full user flow tested manually
- Data verified in database/storage
- User confirms it works as expected

---

## Test Stages: Always Required

**Every plan MUST include automated test stages** matching the framework used by each package being modified.

Refer to `process/skills/tests.md` for framework-by-package mapping, run commands, and key conventions.

### How to Include Tests in Plans

For each RFC or phase that touches a testable package, add a **Test Stage** with:

1. **Test file path** - `packages/api/src/__tests__/<subject>.test.ts`
2. **What to test** - List the specific behaviors/scenarios to cover
3. **Run command** - The exact command to execute tests
4. **Pass criteria** - What "green" looks like (all tests pass, specific assertions)

In the Implementation Checklist, interleave test steps with code steps:

```
- [ ] Implement <feature> in <file>
- [ ] Write tests in src/__tests__/<subject>.test.ts covering: <scenarios>
- [ ] Run `bun test` (or `pnpm test`) — all tests green
```

**A phase is NOT complete if its test stage is skipped or failing.**

---

## How to use this command

- Provide a brief description of your idea/feature/project
- Specify complexity: simple or complex (if omitted, you MUST ask)
- The assistant will ask 3–5 questions per round (max 2–3 rounds) only if needed
- Output is saved to `process/plans/[feature or system's name]_PLAN_[dd-mm-yy].md` (organized by feature, date-stamped for versioning)
- For complex initiatives, review `process/context/example-complex-prd.md` for how detailed the output should be

## Complexity selection

If the user does not specify:

- If scope spans multiple subsystems, requires phased delivery, or includes infra: default to complex
- If scope is a single component/endpoint/UI and can ship in one session: default to simple

Confirm explicitly:

- "Is this SIMPLE (one-session) or COMPLEX (multi-phase)?"

## Interactive Q&A (when needed)

Ask in batches of 3–5, then proceed:

1. Product vision and purpose
2. User needs and behaviors
3. Feature requirements and constraints
4. Business goals and success metrics
5. Implementation considerations (timeline, budget, resources)

Stop asking when sufficient to produce the plan.

---

## Output: [feature or system's name]\_PLAN\_[dd-mm-yy].md

**CRITICAL: Get current date first**

- Run CLI command: `date +%d-%m-%y` to get current date in dd-mm-yy format
- Example output: `06-11-25` for November 6, 2025
- Use this date in the filename

ALWAYS produce EXACTLY ONE file named [feature or system's name]\_PLAN\_[dd-mm-yy].md with:

### Top matter

- Title
- Date
- Complexity: Simple | Complex
- One-paragraph Overview
- Quick Links (internal anchors to sections below)
- Status strip:
  - ✅ VERIFIED, 🔨 CODE DONE, 🧪 TESTING, ⏳ PLANNED, 🚧 BLOCKED markers as appropriate

### Phase Completion Rules (REQUIRED - include in every plan)

```
## Phase Completion Rules

A phase is NOT complete until:

1. **Integration Test** - Works with other system pieces
2. **Manual Test** - User can perform the action
3. **Data Verification** - Database/state changes confirmed
4. **Error Handling** - Failure cases handled gracefully
5. **User Confirmation** - User says "it works"

Status meanings:
- ⏳ PLANNED - Not started
- 🔨 CODE DONE - Written but not E2E tested
- 🧪 TESTING - Currently being tested
- ✅ VERIFIED - Tested AND confirmed working
- 🚧 BLOCKED - Has issues

After each phase, document:
- [ ] What was tested manually
- [ ] Data verified in DB (show query + result)
- [ ] Errors encountered and fixed
- [ ] User confirmation received
```

### If SIMPLE (one-session implementation)

1. Overview
2. Goals and Success Metrics
3. **Phase Completion Rules** (copy from above)
4. **Execution Brief** (required section)
   - Group implementation into 3-6 logical phases
   - For each phase:
     - "What happens" (1-2 sentences)
     - "Test" (specific manual test steps)
     - "Verify" (what to check in DB/state)
     - "Done when" (user confirmation criteria)
   - End with "Expected Outcome" (bullet list of final state)
5. Scope (In/Out)
6. Assumptions and Constraints
7. Functional Requirements (concise bullets)
8. Non-Functional Requirements (only critical items)
9. Acceptance Criteria (testable, 5–10 bullets)
10. Implementation Checklist (single-session TODO)
    - 8–15 atomic steps, each independently verifiable
    - Each step includes: code task + test task
    - Ordered logically for Cursor Plan mode
11. Risks and Mitigations (brief)
12. Integration Notes (dependencies, environment, data model touches)
13. Cursor + RIPER-5 Guidance

- Use Cursor Plan mode: import this checklist
- RIPER-5: RESEARCH → INNOVATE → PLAN, then request EXECUTE
- Avoid code until EXECUTE; if scope expands mid-flight, pause and convert to COMPLEX
- **After each phase: STOP and verify before proceeding**

### If COMPLEX (multi-phase)

Before generating, review `process/context/example-complex-prd.md` to calibrate the expected depth. Your output should be comparable in structure and specificity.

1. Context and Goals
2. **Phase Completion Rules** (copy from above - REQUIRED)
3. **Execution Brief** (required section)
   - Group implementation into logical phase groups (e.g., "Phase 1-4: Foundation")
   - For each phase group:
     - "What happens" (1-2 sentences)
     - "Integration points" (what connects to what)
     - "Test" (specific E2E test procedure)
     - "Verify" (DB queries, API calls to confirm)
     - "Done when" (user confirmation criteria)
   - End with "Expected Outcome" (bullet list of final state)
4. **Phased Execution Workflow** (required section)
   - **IMPORTANT**: This plan uses a phase-by-phase execution model with built-in verification gates
   - For each RFC/Phase, follow this workflow:
     - **Step 1: Pre-Phase Research** - Read existing code patterns, analyze similar implementations, identify blockers, present findings to user. **CRITICAL: Present findings and STOP. Wait for user approval before proceeding to Step 2. Do NOT bundle research + implementation into one agent call.**
     - **Step 2: Detailed Planning** - Create detailed implementation steps, specify exact files, define success criteria, get user approval
     - **Step 3: Implementation** - Execute approved plan exactly as specified, no deviations
     - **Step 4: Testing & Verification** - Execute specific test scenarios, verify in database, document results
     - **Step 5: User Confirmation** - After each stage, the executor MUST present a structured post-stage summary:
       ```
       **What's Functional Now**: What user can do/see after this stage
       **What Was Tested**: Verification performed (DB queries, API calls, build checks, etc.)
       **What You Can Test**: Specific manual steps user can take to verify
         - e.g., commands to run, URLs to visit, UI actions to perform
       **Ready For**: Next stage
       ```
       User manually tests using the steps provided, confirms working, and approves to proceed.
   - **CRITICAL: Do NOT proceed to next phase until current phase is ✅ VERIFIED**
   - Include example phase execution showing the complete workflow — the example MUST show the PAUSE between research and implementation (see `process/context/example-complex-prd.md` lines 132-166 for the pattern to match)
5. Non-Goals and Constraints
6. Architecture Decisions (Final)
   - Numbered decisions with Rationale and Implications
7. Architecture Clarification (Service Separation if any)
8. High-level Data Flow (ASCII ok)
9. Security Posture
10. Component Details
    - Responsibilities
    - Key Flows
    - Future Enhancements
11. Backend Endpoints and Workers
12. Infrastructure Deployment
13. Database Schema (Prisma-style)
14. API Surface (tRPC/REST/GraphQL)
15. Real-time Event Model (if applicable)
16. Phased Delivery Plan

### Cursor Plan + RIPER-5 integration (both modes)

- Cursor Plan mode:
  - Import "Implementation Checklist" steps directly
  - For Complex: Execute by Phase; after each Phase, update status strip and "What's Functional Now"
  - **CRITICAL: After each phase, run verification checklist before proceeding**
  - Reattach [feature or system's name]\_PLAN\_[dd-mm-yy].md to future sessions for context

- RIPER-5 mode:
  - RESEARCH: Discover code/infra context; do not implement
  - INNOVATE: Brainstorm approaches; no decisions yet
  - PLAN: Finalize this [feature or system's name]\_PLAN\_[dd-mm-yy].md; request user approval
  - EXECUTE: Implement EXACTLY as planned; mid-implementation check-in at ~50%
  - **VERIFY: After each phase, stop and run verification checklist**
  - REVIEW: Validate implementation matches plan; flag deviations
  - If scope changes mid-run: pause, run Change Management section, update [feature or system's name]\_PLAN\_[dd-mm-yy].md, then continue

### Formatting rules

- Use clear headings and short bullet lists
- Keep sections minimal in SIMPLE; full detail in COMPLEX
- Include internal anchor links and a short TOC
- Prefer tables where helpful (e.g., feature prioritization)
- Use ✅/🔨/🧪/⏳/🚧 markers consistently
- **Every phase MUST have: Test Procedure + Verification Queries + Done Criteria**

### Deliverable

- Create `process/plans/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Before naming the new plan, list existing completed plans to avoid duplicate feature names (e.g., `ls -1 process/plans/completed/ | tail`)
- Save the entire output to `process/plans/[feature or system's name]_PLAN_[dd-mm-yy].md`

### Begin

1. Get current date: run `date +%d-%m-%y` to obtain date stamp
2. Is this SIMPLE (one-session) or COMPLEX (multi-phase)?
3. If information is missing, ask up to 3–5 questions, then proceed.
4. Generate [feature or system's name]\_PLAN\_[dd-mm-yy].md per the selected mode.
5. For COMPLEX, cross-check structure and depth against `process/context/example-complex-prd.md`.
6. Conclude with a one-line next-step instruction for Cursor Plan mode.
7. **Remind user: Each phase requires verification before proceeding to next.**
