# Development Rules

**IMPORTANT:** Skill discovery is handled by the orchestrator per Step 0 in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Within execution, activate additional skills as needed for the specific task.
**IMPORTANT:** You ALWAYS follow these principles: **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

## General
- **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for file names with a meaningful name that describes the purpose of the file, doesn't matter if the file name is long, just make sure when LLMs read the file names while using Grep or other tools, they can understand the purpose of the file right away without reading the file content.
- **File Size Management**: Keep individual code files under 200 lines for optimal context management
  - Split large files into smaller, focused components/modules
  - Use composition over inheritance for complex widgets
  - Extract utility functions into separate modules
  - Create dedicated service classes for business logic
  - Note: This rule applies to TypeScript/JavaScript source files. Markdown documentation and agent/skill instruction files (*.md in .claude/) are exempt.
- For library/API docs, the orchestrator will surface `docs-seeker` skill automatically (Step 0). During execution, use the Context7 MCP tools directly (already configured in CLAUDE.md).
- Use `gh` bash command to interact with Github features if needed
- Use `drizzle-kit studio` or direct SQLite/libSQL queries via Drizzle ORM for database debugging if needed
- Use `ai-multimodal` skill for describing details of images, videos, documents, etc. if needed
- Use `ai-multimodal` skill and `imagemagick` skill for generating and editing images, videos, documents, etc. if needed
- Use `sequential-thinking` and `debug` skills for sequential thinking, analyzing code, debugging, etc. if needed
- **[IMPORTANT]** Follow the codebase structure and code standards in `process/context` during implementation.
- **[IMPORTANT]** Do not just simulate the implementation or mocking them, always implement the real code.

## Code Quality Guidelines
- Read and follow codebase structure and code standards in `process/context`
- Don't be too harsh on code linting, but **make sure there are no syntax errors and code are compilable**
- Prioritize functionality and readability over strict style enforcement and code formatting
- Use reasonable code quality standards that enhance developer productivity
- Use try catch error handling & cover security standards
- Run code review after every implementation

## Pre-commit/Push Rules
- Run linting before commit
- Run tests before push (DO NOT ignore failed tests just to pass the build or github actions)
- Keep commits focused on the actual code changes
- **DO NOT** commit and push any confidential information (such as dotenv files, API keys, database credentials, etc.) to git repository!
- Create clean, professional commit messages without AI references. Use conventional commit format.

## Code Implementation
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow established architectural patterns
- Implement features according to specifications
- Handle edge cases and error scenarios
- **DO NOT** create new enhanced files, update to the existing files directly.
